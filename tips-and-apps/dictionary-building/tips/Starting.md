*Those are general tips, and you may do however you want*

# Creating a *theory*
A theory is the set of rules your dictionary will follow.
It's useful because it makes briefs easier to add, easier to recall.

You may free-style it and change parts of it later. 
But the more briefs you already have, the harder it will be to change your dictionary according to your theory.

The theory aims to make writting shorter and more consistent, so you should try to avoid conflicting rules.
(when in a brief, it's unclear what the expansion would be, or when a word is unclear on what the brief could be)
It's hard to make a conflict-free theory, and may not be worth it, so dont' be too afraid to introduce some if it shorten the writting.

(example of how a theory may look like in examples/EnglishBriefingTheory.odt)

So, in general, giving the writting structure.

Some question you may ask yourself:
- Finding a way to write common suffixs/preffixs.
- Finding a way to write really common words. (Those are so common that it may not make sense to use logical letters for them if it make the rest easier)
- Will it be heavy on phrases? (Quaverly, a court-reporter using serial-steno recommand heavily phrases)
- Will it be more phonetic or more orthographic? (Depends on what you find the easier to think of, phonetic creates homophones though, which you would have to write in full or be partially orthoragphic in your writting)
- Based on another system?
- How to handle negation?

When starting out, you'll probably have no clue on what to do, so take your time to experiment.

# Adding briefs to your dictionary

Do it by blocks, so that at a given moment, you know what's in your dictionary and what's not.
Blocks may be word varients, phrases, homonymes, homophones, field-specific language, etc.
(I would recommand to use ../app/FastBriefCreator.jl to make phrases and word varients in mass, after putting your text-editor/expander syntax)

If you encounter a word/phrase a lot, add it, then add whatever seems related.
You gain more keypresses by shortening common, even if short, words, than to shorten long uncommon words.
